Implementation of Hilbert calculus

Simply the main goal is to create a library that can give the steps of the proof of a given Sigma |- F task. For this we can use different algorithms. At the moment there is only one algorithm to use.

This project is made in Visual Studio 2012.
Linux/gcc support coming soon.
